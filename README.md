# pesterquest-modsuite
Tools for modifying and extending pesterquest, and adding your own routes
WIP tools for adding your own routes to pesterquest without breaking the base game or needing a standalone engine!

Technical notes:

This does not overwrite any game files and should be compatable with all future updates!
The only content this overrides is the main menu to add a menu option. (Here, just a plain `> ` for now.)
You cannot use any of this to pirate pesterquest.
